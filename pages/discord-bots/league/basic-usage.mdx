## How to Manage Your Team

Team management is done 100% through our bot. These are the commands you as a `Captain` have access to:

- `/roster add` - Adds a member to your team
- `/roster kick` - Kicks a member from your team
- `/roster set-captain` - Sets a new captain and removes yourself as one
- `/edit-team` - Change your team's name and color (can only execute once a week)
- `/disband-team` - Disband your team. This kicks everyone and sets your team to `Disbanded`. The data and role are saved in case you want to reform again
- `/team-availability set` - Set your team's availability. This will determine what matches you get during the week. *By default, all slots are set to false (no availability)*

Some other team commands that everyone has access to:
- `/roster view` - View a team's roster
- `/team-availability view` - View your team's availability.
