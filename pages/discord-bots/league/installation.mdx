# Installation

<Steps>
    ### Step 1

    Click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1249791301487034438&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot) to add the bot to your Discord server.

    ### Step 2

    #### Set the command permissions in your Discord Server's settings

    **Server Settings &rarr; Integrations &rarr; Bots and Apps &rarr; ETHR League**

    <Callout type={"info"}>It is recommended you disable all commands by default and work your way from there.</Callout>

    <Callout type={"warning"}>Make sure all `admin` and `sync-users` commands are not executable by default.</Callout>

    ### Step 3
    Ensure you have a bot that handles react for roles. The role `Free Agent` is required to be able to join a team.
    This allows players to toggle getting added to teams.

    ### Step 4 (Optional)
    Use the command `/config` to configure the bot.
</Steps>

And you're done! `:D`
