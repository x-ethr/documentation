## What is the League Bot?

The League Bot is a discord bot that automates your competitive (or casual) league 100% inside of Discord! This includes rosters, players,
leaderboards, elo calculation, and more.

This bot started its life as a very simple bot written by peenie (ethanzs) for the Mordhau competitive league **NACL**
(North American Competitive League). After years of refinement, thousands of players & testers, and a full refactor
to allow multi-guild usage (free for all to use) here it is!
